   **Maximum Sum of Subarray (using Dynamic Programming)**
   * This problem is a variation of Kadane's algorithm problem Maximum Sum of Subarray as the numbers in all subsets are non-adjacent in the original array
   * **Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers, find the subset of non-adjacent elements with the maximum sum. Calculate the sum of that subset.
   * The solution has time complexity O(N) and passed 32/32 test cases
